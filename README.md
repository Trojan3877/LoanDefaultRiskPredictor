# LoanDefaultRiskPredictor
Predictor for Loan Defaults
This project showcases the full ML pipeline from data ingestion to model evaluation. The model was trained on a publicly available dataset and evaluated using industry metrics such as F1-score and ROC-AUC. The purpose was to simulate a FinTech risk modeling scenario that financial institutions face daily. This project demonstrates proficiency in feature engineering, model selection, metric evaluation, and clear code documentation.
